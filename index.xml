The short of it is:
If you&amp;rsquo;re using Enzo or FLASH, you can probably do most of what you want to do with 3.0. But there are probably bugs, and you can&amp;rsquo;t volume render yet. But every bug or missing feature you find is a useful piece of information that can help speed up development.

The workshop will be aimed at both users and developers of yt. We will begin with intensive user training, moving from basic usage to advanced and parallel usage. Users are encouraged to bring their ideas and prototypes for new analysis routines as there will be opportunities to work with more experienced developers. We will then address to how to modify, extend and contribute to yt, and transition to a developers workshop.</description></item><item><title>New Screencasts</title><link>https://yt-project.github.io/blog/posts/post_32_new-screencasts/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Sep 2011 12:20:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://yt-project.github.io/blog/posts/post_32_new-screencasts/</guid><description>A few of the yt developers have been experimenting with screencasts to show off new features or demonstrate how to do some things.

On any machine that runs yt, there is a file created in the users home directory named ~/.yt/parameter_files.csv that yt uses internally to keep track of datasets it has seen. This is just a simple text file containing comma-separated entries with a few pieces of information about datasets, like their location on disk and the last date and time they were &amp;lsquo;seen&amp;rsquo; by yt.</description></item><item><title>Optimizing yt</title><link>https://yt-project.github.io/blog/posts/post_30_optimizing-yt/</link><pubDate>Sat, 10 Sep 2011 08:39:52 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://yt-project.github.io/blog/posts/post_30_optimizing-yt/</guid><description>This last week, following the release of version 2.2 of yt, I spent a bit of time looking at speed improvements. There were several places that the code was unacceptably slow:
1D profiles (as noted in our method paper, even) Ghost-zone generation RAMSES grid data loading The first of these was relatively easy to fix. In the past, 1D profiles (unlike 2D profiles) were calculated using pure-python mechanisms; numpy was used for digitization, then inverse binning was conducted by the numpy &amp;lsquo;where&amp;rsquo; command, and these binnings were used to generate the overall histogram.</description></item><item><title>yt-2.2 Release Announcement</title><link>https://yt-project.github.io/blog/posts/post_29_yt-2-2-release-announcement/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Sep 2011 06:56:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://yt-project.github.io/blog/posts/post_29_yt-2-2-release-announcement/</guid><description>(Please feel encouraged to forward this message to any other interested parties.)
We are proud to announce the release of yt version 2.2. This release includes several new features, bug fixes, and numerous improvements to the code base and documentation.

The yt Hub is a gathering place for all things related to running, analyzing, and presenting astrophysical simulations. Once upon a time, we had the Enzotools Barn, which was a place to share Enzo scripts unrelated to yt, including hosting of those scripts. The Barn was a minor success, but had a very limited scope and a somewhat clunky user experience.</description></item><item><title>We're now the yt Project!</title><link>https://yt-project.github.io/blog/posts/post_26_we-re-now-the-yt-project/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Aug 2011 08:39:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://yt-project.github.io/blog/posts/post_26_we-re-now-the-yt-project/</guid><description>This is just a brief blog entry &amp;ndash; other news is on the way soon! &amp;ndash; to let everyone know we&amp;rsquo;ve updated our domains.

The old homepage was nice and functional, but it tried to cram too much into too small a place. The new homepage focuses on the three main questions people have when they go to the yt page: &amp;lsquo;How do I get it?', &amp;lsquo;How do I use it?', and &amp;lsquo;How do I participate?&amp;rsquo;
The new page is focused on some concrete examples, some quantitative analysis, and features a heavy dosage of the yt community &amp;ndash; in fact, the redesign came about through a conversation in IRC, where a few of the core developers were speculating about how best to convey how to participate and how strong a community yt has.</description></item><item><title>ParaView and yt</title><link>https://yt-project.github.io/blog/posts/post_23_paraview-and-yt/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Jun 2011 20:09:34 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://yt-project.github.io/blog/posts/post_23_paraview-and-yt/</guid><description>Thanks to some awesome work by developers at Kitware, yt can now be called from within ParaView!
This relies on a couple things, all of which are pretty exciting moving forward. The idea behind this is to leverage where the two codes have their own strengths and weaknesses, and identify places where they can work productively together. For instance, yt has been designed to provide astrophysical analysis; in this way, it can generate adaptive projections, spectral energy distributions and so on.</description></item><item><title>Gmaps-ify your data!</title><link>https://yt-project.github.io/blog/posts/post_22_gmaps-ify-your-data/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Jun 2011 21:08:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://yt-project.github.io/blog/posts/post_22_gmaps-ify-your-data/</guid><description>A couple of us have been working on a comprehensive notebook web GUI for yt.

This is a small, standalone webapp that implements a rendered-on-the-fly google maps interface in yt. To run it, just go into a directory that has some data, and run:
yt mapserver DD0054/DD0054 (where &amp;lsquo;DD0054/DD0054&amp;rsquo; is the same thing you&amp;rsquo;d feed to &amp;lsquo;load&amp;rsquo; in a script.</description></item><item><title>yt development - Quad trees, Tickets and more</title><link>https://yt-project.github.io/blog/posts/post_21_yt-development-quad-trees-tickets-and-more/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Jun 2011 20:20:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://yt-project.github.io/blog/posts/post_21_yt-development-quad-trees-tickets-and-more/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since the last Development post — but in that time, some pretty fun things have been going on. These are some of the smaller things, but there are bigger things in store which I&amp;rsquo;ll write about next time.
QuadTree Projections For a while, there has been the option to use a QuadTree data structure to conduct projections through a simulation volume. This was accessible through the quad_proj attribute, which respected the same interface as the normal proj interface.</description></item><item><title>yt Logo Contest, and possibly a free mug!</title><link>https://yt-project.github.io/blog/posts/post_20_yt-logo-contest-and-possibly-a-free-mug/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Apr 2011 17:46:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://yt-project.github.io/blog/posts/post_20_yt-logo-contest-and-possibly-a-free-mug/</guid><description>yt is in need of an awesome new logo, which is why we are announcing the first ever new logo contest!

We&amp;rsquo;ll accept entries for the next two weeks. Let&amp;rsquo;s arbitrarily say Tuesday, May 10th, at 11:59:59 pm EST. If there is more than one entry, we will put it up for a community vote at that time.
Oh, and the most important part &amp;ndash; the winner will get a coffee mug with their new logo front and center!</description></item><item><title>yt 2.1 Release Announcement</title><link>https://yt-project.github.io/blog/posts/post_19_yt-2-1-release-announcement/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Apr 2011 04:57:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://yt-project.github.io/blog/posts/post_19_yt-2-1-release-announcement/</guid><description>We are proud to announce the release of yt version 2.1. This release includes several new features, bug fixes, and numerous improvements to the code base and documentation. At the yt homepage, http://yt.enzotools.org/ , an installation script, a cookbook, documentation and a guide to getting involved can be found.
yt is an analysis and visualization toolkit for Adaptive Mesh Refinement data. yt provides full support for Enzo, Orion, and FLASH codes, with preliminary support for RAMSES, ART, Chombo, CASTRO and MAESTRO codes.</description></item><item><title>yt development - Treecodes, GUIs, IRC and more!</title><link>https://yt-project.github.io/blog/posts/post_18_yt-development-treecodes-guis-irc-and-more/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Apr 2011 06:40:54 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://yt-project.github.io/blog/posts/post_18_yt-development-treecodes-guis-irc-and-more/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s been nearly a month since the last yt development post; in that time, there&amp;rsquo;s been quite a bit of development in a couple different areas. This is culminating in a 2.1 release, for which Sam Skillman is release manager, sometime in the next few days.
Streamlines and Treecode SamS has spent some time over the last month developing two types of streamline code. The first integrates a series of streamlines over a selection of the domain, which can then be visualizing using the mplot3d package.</description></item><item><title>yt development - External Analysis and Simulation Code Support</title><link>https://yt-project.github.io/blog/posts/post_17_yt-development-external-analysis-and-simulation-code-support/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Mar 2011 06:17:09 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://yt-project.github.io/blog/posts/post_17_yt-development-external-analysis-and-simulation-code-support/</guid><description>This last week was the first full week on BitBucket and so far I think it has been quite successful. The new development process is for most of the core developers to maintain personal forks for experimental changes, or longer term changes, and then to commit directly or merge when bug fixes or features are ready to be integrated. The list of forks is easily visible and each individual fork&amp;rsquo;s divergence from the primary repository can be viewed by clicking on the green arrows.</description></item><item><title>yt development - BitBucket, Task Queues, and Streamlines</title><link>https://yt-project.github.io/blog/posts/post_16_yt-development-bitbucket-task-queues-and-streamlines/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Feb 2011 05:35:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://yt-project.github.io/blog/posts/post_16_yt-development-bitbucket-task-queues-and-streamlines/</guid><description>The major changes this week came mostly in the form of administrative shifts. However, SamS did some great work I&amp;rsquo;m going to hint at (he&amp;rsquo;ll post a blog entry later) and I started laying the ground work for something I&amp;rsquo;ve been excited about for a while, an MPI-aware task queue.

This shows the all-sky rendering of an observer moving from the front face of a simulation through the volume to the back face. The test simulation is 32 Mpc/h on a side with 64^3 root grid cells and up to 4 levels of refinement. At the start it looks like a disc because the entire simulation is in front of the camera and by the end it is all around the sides, indicating the simulation is behind the camera.</description></item><item><title>yt development - HEALpix and Contour Tree</title><link>https://yt-project.github.io/blog/posts/post_14_yt-development-healpix-and-contour-tree/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Feb 2011 04:14:53 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://yt-project.github.io/blog/posts/post_14_yt-development-healpix-and-contour-tree/</guid><description>This week there was not very much yt development. However, a few notes may be of interest. SamS has updated the HEALPix camera to support ordered projections; what this means is that you can now make volume renderings using a standard color transfer function, or even the Planck transfer function, that cover 4pi of the sky. I am still working on integrating a method for creating images easily, but for now the scripts from last week should work.</description></item><item><title>yt development - All-sky column density calculation</title><link>https://yt-project.github.io/blog/posts/post_13_yt-development-all-sky-column-density-calculation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Feb 2011 06:13:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://yt-project.github.io/blog/posts/post_13_yt-development-all-sky-column-density-calculation/</guid><description>This week I added the ability to calculate all-sky column densities. This functionality uses HEALpix to calculate equally-area regions on the sky and then shoots out rays from a central source to some fixed radius, accumulating values of a field along the way. Although so far I&amp;rsquo;ve only used it to calculate column densities of &amp;ldquo;Density&amp;rdquo; it could be used for other values as well, including all- sky weighted averages of quantities.</description></item><item><title>yt development - Documentation</title><link>https://yt-project.github.io/blog/posts/post_12_yt-development-documentation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Feb 2011 05:29:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://yt-project.github.io/blog/posts/post_12_yt-development-documentation/</guid><description>As a result of progress in my scientific goals, and the application of recent yt developments to them, I did not make many changes or developments in yt this week. When I did work on yt, I primarily spent time re-organizing the documentation and fixing several errors. I have added an &amp;ldquo;installation&amp;rdquo; section, consolidated a few sections, and wrote two new sections on how to make plots and on how to generate derived data products.</description></item><item><title>yt development - Time series, and more</title><link>https://yt-project.github.io/blog/posts/post_11_yt-development-time-series-and-more/</link><pubDate>Mon, 31 Jan 2011 04:53:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://yt-project.github.io/blog/posts/post_11_yt-development-time-series-and-more/</guid><description>Not much yt development went on in the last week; I spent some time working with Enzo and driving forward simulation goals, which resulted in some development that directly benefited those simulation goals. However, this fortuitously coincided with work I have been eager to return to for quite some time: namely, time series analysis!

I conducted two different tests, both of which operated on the 512^3, 7 level &amp;lsquo;Santa Fe Light Cone&amp;rsquo; dataset RD0036. This dataset has 5.5e8 total cells and in the neighborhood of 380,000 grids. I ran four different tests: a 1D profile of the entire dataset, a 2D profile of the entire dataset, and projections of both &amp;lsquo;Density&amp;rsquo; (requires IO) and &amp;lsquo;Ones&amp;rsquo; (doesn&amp;rsquo;t require IO).</description></item><item><title>Quad Tree Projections</title><link>https://yt-project.github.io/blog/posts/post_04_quad-tree-projections/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Sep 2010 21:41:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://yt-project.github.io/blog/posts/post_04_quad-tree-projections/</guid><description>The current method for projections in yt is based on a home-grown algorithm for calculating grid overlap and joining points. I&amp;rsquo;ve always been pretty proud of it &amp;ndash; it gave good results, and it succeeded at the project-once-make-many-images philosophy that went into its design. Rather than storing a 2D array of pixels, projections and slices in yt store flat arrays of image plane coordinates and cell widths. This means that there&amp;rsquo;s an additional step of pixelization to create an image, but it also means that arbitrary images can be made from a single projection or slice operation.</description></item><item><title>How the Merger Tree Sped Up SQLite Database UPDATEs</title><link>https://yt-project.github.io/blog/posts/post_03_how-the-merger-tree-sped-up-sqlite-database-update-s/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Sep 2010 13:26:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://yt-project.github.io/blog/posts/post_03_how-the-merger-tree-sped-up-sqlite-database-update-s/</guid><description>The Parallel Merger Tree in yt, like most of the code in yt, has a rich history of changes and upgrades. One of the most significant upgrades was a change in the way the SQLite database file is updated during the course of building the merger tree.

Mercurial is a distributed version control system, not unlike git or bzr, where each checkout brings with it the entire history of the repository and enables full development. Each individual can commit changes to their own repository, while still accepting changes from others. It also makes it much easier to submit patches upstream.</description></item><item><title>Figuring Out Stereo Volume Rendering</title><link>https://yt-project.github.io/blog/posts/post_01_figuring-out-stereo-volume-rendering/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 May 2010 09:13:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://yt-project.github.io/blog/posts/post_01_figuring-out-stereo-volume-rendering/</guid><description>Last week I was approached by a friend and collaborator to prepare some large volume renderings using the software volume renderer in yt.

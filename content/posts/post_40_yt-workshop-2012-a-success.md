The yt workshop last week in Chicago (
<http://yt-project.org/workshop2012/> ) was an enormous success. On
behalf of the organizing and technical committees, I'd like to
specifically thank the FLASH Center, particularly Don Lamb, Mila Kuntu,
Carrie Eder, for their hospitality; the venue was outstanding and their
hospitality touching. Additionally, we're very grateful to the Adler
Planetarium's Doug Roberts and Mark SubbaRao for hosting us on Wednesday
evening -- seeing the planetarium show as well as volume renderings made
by yt users up on the dome was so much fun. The yt workshop was
supported by NSF Grant 1214147. Thanks to everyone who attended -- your
energy and excitement helped make it a success.

Thanks also to the organizing and technical committees: Britton Smith,
John ZuHone, Brian O'Shea, Jeff Oishi, Stephen Skory, Sam Skillman, and
Cameron Hummels. All talks have been recorded, and you can clone a
unified repository of talk slides and worked examples:

``` bash
hg clone https://bitbucket.org/yt_analysis/workshop2012/ 
```

A few photos have been put up online, too: <http://goo.gl/g02uP>

As I am able to edit and upload talks, they'll appear on the yt youtube
channel as well as on the yt homepage:

Thanks again, and wow, what a week!

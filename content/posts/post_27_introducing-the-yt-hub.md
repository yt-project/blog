I am very excited to announce the yt Hub: <http://hub.yt-project.org/>.

The yt Hub is a gathering place for all things related to running,
analyzing, and presenting astrophysical simulations. Once upon a time,
we had the Enzotools Barn, which was a place to share Enzo scripts
unrelated to yt, including hosting of those scripts. The Barn was a
minor success, but had a very limited scope and a somewhat clunky user
experience.

Now we have the yt Hub, where users can submit externally- hosted
projects in a variety of categories:

> -   yt scripts
> -   Analysis and visualization tools and utilities
> -   Simulation and data management
> -   Scripts for making figures from published papers
> -   News and announcements
> -   General astrophysical utilities

Users can create their own accounts and share anything they've created
that might be useful to others. Currently, the preferred submission
method is to create a repository on
[bitbucket.org](http://bitbucket.org/) and then submit the link to that.
If you would like to host the repository for your contribution somewhere
else, that's fine, too. The forthcoming 2.2 release of yt will include a
utility for automating the creation and uploading of a
[bitbucket.org](http://bitbucket.org/) repository as well as submitting
that repository to the Hub.

In addition, users may also subscribe to email announcements, in which
they will receive an email with any new submissions from the previous
day.

Please, come check it out and contribute. The site is brand new, so feel
free to send feedback if you encounter any oddities or think of
improvements. The primary goal of yt has been to create a common
analysis language for computational astrophysicists coming from
different simulation codes. We hope that the yt Hub will serve as the
meeting place for the conversation.

# A mission statement and a new homepage!

In case you haven't visited our front page lately, the yt homepage has
been [redesigned](http://yt.enzotools.org/)! The old homepage was nice
and functional, but it tried to cram too much into too small a place.
The new homepage focuses on the three main questions people have when
they go to the yt page: 'How do I get it?', 'How do I use it?', and 'How
do I participate?'

The new page is focused on some concrete examples, some quantitative
analysis, and features a heavy dosage of the yt community -- in fact,
the redesign came about through a conversation in IRC, where a few of
the core developers were speculating about how best to convey how to
participate and how strong a community yt has. The new homepage also
features a mission statement. ([Discussion of the mission
statement](http://goo.gl/RNUzH).) It's designed to reflect the goals and
ambitions -- not where the end of the road is, but which direction it is
pointed. To be honest, as the person who initiated that discussion, I
was a bit surprised at how far reaching the discussion became. The
mission statement we converged on is reproduced here, but over time it
might evolve and be refined.

Feel free to stop by the IRC channel or the mailing lists if this piques
your interest and you'd like to chat more.

## Mission Statement

> The yt project aims to produce an integrated science environment for
> collaboratively asking and answering astrophysical questions. To do
> so, it will encompass the creation of initial conditions, the
> execution of simulations, and the detailed exploration and
> visualization of the resultant data. It will also provide a standard
> framework based on physical quantities interoperability between codes.
>
> Development of yt is driven by a commitment to Open Science principles
> as manifested in participatory development, reproducibility,
> documented and approachable code, a friendly and helpful community of
> users and developers, and Free and Libre Open Source Software.

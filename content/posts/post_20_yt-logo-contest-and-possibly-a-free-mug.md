yt is in need of an awesome new logo, which is why we are announcing the
first ever new logo contest! So here's the deal:

We'll accept entries for the next two weeks. Let's arbitrarily say
Tuesday, May 10th, at 11:59:59 pm EST. If there is more than one entry,
we will put it up for a community vote at that time.

Oh, and the most important part -- the winner will get a coffee mug with
their new logo front and center!!!

Please email <yt@enzotools.org> with your image attached. Good luck, and
happy logo-ing!

Sam

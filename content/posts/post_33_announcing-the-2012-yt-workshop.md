I'm pleased to announce the 2012 yt Workshop at the FLASH Center in
Chicago, January 24-26.

The workshop will be aimed at both users and developers of yt. We will
begin with intensive user training, moving from basic usage to advanced
and parallel usage. Users are encouraged to bring their ideas and
prototypes for new analysis routines as there will be opportunities to
work with more experienced developers. We will then address to how to
modify, extend and contribute to yt, and transition to a developers
workshop. In the developers portion of the workshop, we will discuss
ideas for improvements to the code and then break into groups to
implement new features. Users are highly encouraged to stay and
participate in development. The FLASH Center has graciously offered to
host the workshop. We have identified a hotel in downtown Chicago (near
the river, just off Michigan Avenue) that we are able to book
double-occupancy rooms for $99/night, pre-tax. We are actively pursuing
funding opportunities, but as of yet have not secured funding for
participant costs; if we are able to do so, it will likely cover hotel
stays for a limited number of individuals willing to share rooms for the
four nights of the workshop (Jan. 23-26).

As we prepare hotel reservations, funding applications and other
technicalities, we need to get a sense of not only how many people are
potentially going to attend, but also their current career stage,
funding availability and so on. If you are interested in attending the
workshop, we would greatly appreciate it if you would visit the
following URL and fill out the Google Form: <http://goo.gl/xElrB> . If
you have already filled it out, no need to do it again!

Once we have the details of the conference settled, further information
will be forthcoming regarding registration, accommodations, and possible
financial support.

We’re proud to announce the release of version 2.4 of the yt Project,
<http://yt-project.org/> . The new version includes many new features,
refinements of existing features and numerous bugfixes. We encourage all
users to upgrade to take advantage of the changes.

yt is a community-developed analysis and visualization toolkit,
primarily directed at astrophysical hydrodynamics simulations. It
provides full support for output from the Enzo, FLASH, Orion, and Nyx
codes, with preliminary support for several others. It provides access
to simulation data using an intuitive python interface, can perform many
common visualization tasks and offers a framework for conducting data
reductions and analysis of simulation data.

The most visible changes with the 2.4 release include:

> -   A threaded volume renderer, which has been completely rewritten
>     for speed, clarity and extensibility
> -   A new plotting mechanism, the “Plot Window,” for easier and more
>     efficient visualization
> -   Many improvements to time series analysis, including
>     auto-parallelization
> -   A complete rewrite of the Web GUI for yt including a WebGL 3D
>     scene and substantial user interface improvements
> -   Integration with the new yt Hub (<http://hub.yt-project.org/> )
>     for sharing of data, scripts and images
> -   Extensive additions and improvements to the cookbook

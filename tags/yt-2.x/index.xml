This is culminating in a 2.1 release, for which Sam Skillman is release manager, sometime in the next few days.
Streamlines and Treecode SamS has spent some time over the last month developing two types of streamline code. The first integrates a series of streamlines over a selection of the domain, which can then be visualizing using the mplot3d package.</description></item><item><title>yt development - 2.0, Cython, and physics module wrapping</title><link>https://yt-project.github.io/blog/posts/post_10_yt-development-2-0-cython-and-physics-module-wrapping/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Jan 2011 07:10:50 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://yt-project.github.io/blog/posts/post_10_yt-development-2-0-cython-and-physics-module-wrapping/</guid><description>This is the second blog entry in the weekly series, with some updates on what took place last week with respect to yt development. One of the more exciting things is the final one, which is the start of what I want to focus on for the next couple months or years: integration of physics modules with analysis code, and then the ultimate inversion of that relationship.

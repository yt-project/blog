I conducted two different tests, both of which operated on the 512^3, 7 level \u0026lsquo;Santa Fe Light Cone\u0026rsquo; dataset RD0036. This dataset has 5.5e8 total cells and in the neighborhood of 380,000 grids. I ran four different tests: a 1D profile of the entire dataset, a 2D profile of the entire dataset, and projections of both \u0026lsquo;Density\u0026rsquo; (requires IO) and \u0026lsquo;Ones\u0026rsquo; (doesn\u0026rsquo;t require IO).","tags":["archive"],"title":"Improvements to Parallelism","url":"https://munkm.github.io/yt-blog/posts/post_05_improvements-to-parallelism/"},{"categories":["archive"],"description":"The current method for projections in yt is based on a home-grown algorithm for calculating grid overlap and joining points. I\u0026rsquo;ve always been pretty proud of it \u0026ndash; it gave good results, and it succeeded at the project-once-make-many-images philosophy that went into its design. Rather than storing a 2D array of pixels, projections and slices in yt store flat arrays of image plane coordinates and cell widths. This means that there\u0026rsquo;s an additional step of pixelization to create an image, but it also means that arbitrary images can be made from a single projection or slice operation.","tags":["archive","yt-core"],"title":"Quad Tree Projections","url":"https://munkm.github.io/yt-blog/posts/post_04_quad-tree-projections/"},{"categories":["archive"],"description":"The Parallel Merger Tree in yt, like most of the code in yt, has a rich history of changes and upgrades. One of the most significant upgrades was a change in the way the SQLite database file is updated during the course of building the merger tree.

Mercurial is a distributed version control system, not unlike git or bzr, where each checkout brings with it the entire history of the repository and enables full development.
